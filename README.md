# RUSTUP!

This documents my progress of learning Rust. I'm using the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/) as a guide.
But, in all honesty, I am following Brad Traversy's [Rust Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw) as well. Okay I'm just copying his code.
But, what I was really trying new is to learn by AI. I am using ChatGPT and GitHub
copilot to help me write code. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm going to try it out.

## What is Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## How is my rust journey going?
Well, it is going awesome. I love rust. It is like a more street smart brother of
python. I love that it gives me the power to write low level code in a higher level
syntax. It is so fast too.

## Updates?
For updates, check out my updates board on my website [noobScience.rocks](https://new.noobscience.rocks/updates).

## How to run the code?
Just run `cargo run` in the directory of the project you want to run.
Be sure to have rust installed on your machine.
If you don't have rust installed, you can install it by running `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` in your terminal.

## How to contribute?
If you want to contribute, just fork the repo and make a pull request. I will review it and merge it if it is good.
